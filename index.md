Hi! My name is Konrad Patucha. I am a theoretical physics PhD specializing in emergent phenomena in complex condensed matter systems. I am also interested in machine learning.

Currently I am working as a Data Scientist at [Kaczmarski Group](https://kaczmarskigroup.pl/). Previously I was Quantitative Analyst at [Allianz Quantitative Analytics](https://www.allianz.de/) and Assitant Professor at [ILTSR PAS](https://www.intibs.pl/).

In my free time I experiment in the kitchen and play video games and board games.
